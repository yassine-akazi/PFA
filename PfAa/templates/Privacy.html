            to ensure your safety, and that of patients who may receive your donations. If we find a problem with your health, we will let you know. If appropriate we will also tell your GP, after asking your permission to do so.
            for clinical audit, to assess and improve our service. We routinely audit all aspects of the donation process, for example to check that the Donor Safety Check forms are completed properly, and that interviews with our healthcare professionals are conducted in accordance with the guidelines. Results of audits are always presented with all donor identities removed.
            for research, to improve our knowledge about the donor population. By looking at the sorts of people who become active donors, we can understand better how to meet their expectations of us, and identify opportunities for recruiting and retaining more donors. This is essential to help us to collect adequate supplies of all types of blood.
            For management and administration, for example to help us to plan where and when to hold collection sessions.<br>
            Whenever personal identifiers are not needed for these tasks, if possible we remove them from the information we use.<br>
            <br>

            All information about you and your donations is stored securely in our systems to ensure that we have a complete record of your donations. We also keep the Donor Safety Check forms you complete every time you attend to donate. We are required by law (The Blood Safety and Quality Regulations 2005) to keep donor and donation information for a minimum of 30 years.<br>
            <br>
            It is very important to us to keep your address and contact details up to date, so that we are able to stay in touch. To do this we may compare the details we hold with central NHS records or those of other organisations that offer approved services for checking and updating addresses.<br>
            <br>
            As we are an NHS organisation, we may use peopleâ€™s NHS numbers to help us ensure correct identification and to find and remove duplicate records on our systems.<br>
            <br>
            Other than for keeping our own records up to date against central records, we do not allow any other organisation to access the donor base.<br> 
            <br>
            We do not give or sell donor details to any third parties.<br>
            <br>
            As part of the NHS our lawful basis to hold and process data is set out in articles 6(e) and 9(h) of current data protection legislation. In summary, it necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, which in the case of NHSBT is to enable the collection and processing of the donations required to produce blood products for NHS hospitals.

        <p>
            There are currently three categories of communications that donors are not able to withdraw consent from receiving: <br>
                <br>
                1. Donor Digital Service related communications <br>

                <br>
                If you do not want to receive appointment booking and amendment confirmation communications, please call us to arrange your appointment on + (123) 456 7890<br>
                <br>
                2. Appointment cancellations<br>
                <br>
                In the event that we need to cancel an appointment that you have already booked, we will use the contact information you have provided to advise you accordingly.

                <br>
                3. British Bone Marrow Registry (BBMR) invitation<br>
                <br>
                If you join the BBMR and are identified as a possible match with a patient, then NHSBT will contact you to ask if you would like to proceed, ask you to provide further blood samples for testing and potentially ask you to come into one of our specialist centres for an explanation of the procedures and to donate.
